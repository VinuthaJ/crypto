Extended standard cryptographic techniques having algorithmic limitations to apply new technologies like 
DNA Computing, Diffie-Hellman key exchange and Image steganography based on pixel manipulation.

LSB method and sequential embedding are not very secure. Hence we use the secret key generated from the 
Diffie-Hellman Algorithm as a value to place and retrieve the message on the pixel.

This will make sure that embedding onto the pixel is not sequential but also makes sure that if the key
generated is not the same as the sender’s, the receiver won’t be able to retrieve a proper message.
